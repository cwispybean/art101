            <p>Hi, My name is Evelyn Fu. I like to play a variety of video games, but for the most part Minecraft. I also enjoy doing art and learning new ways to apply those skills to create new media.
               My partner is Jing Li, an international student from China, and he is a really nice partner to work with, making labs completed pretty smoothly.</p>
